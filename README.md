# Car_Simulation_Game
CISC 4900 Brooklyn College Senior Project - Car Simulation game in Unreal Engine 5

The purpose of this project is to create a Car Simulation game in Unreal Engine 5. Game assets (car meshes) will be designed in blender and imported into Unreal Engine 5.

A major focus of this project will be on level design, with a custom designed level in Unreal Engine 5 using native assets and assets from the marketplace where needed.

The user will be able to freely explore the level and interact with objects. 

Note: This readme file will undergo more changes as the project develops
